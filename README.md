# math-app-ui

This repo contain the ui web page I created for the math-app application, it's only a preview for the 2 projects.<br/>
To view the preview page [please CLICK HERE](http://math-app-ui.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/).<br/><br/>
The program consists of 2 parts - the server and the client.<br/>

# What is the purpose of this application?
The main purpose of this application is to perform mathematical calculations and return the data back to the user.
<br/><br/>
To write this project I used Java Networking Programming tools (java.net) and it's designed to handle several math clients, meaning, it is a multi-threaded system.
<br/><br/>
For this purpose, I used Java's Thread Object and implemented the singleton pattern as only 1 server should exist per application.
In addition, throughout the program I used additional design patterns such as Factory pattern and Mediator pattern.
<br/><br/>
Plus, on the client server, I added a thread that listens to all input from the server, logs INFO messages and documents data to a local log file.
<br/><br/>
I wrote this program inspired by a good friend of mine who is very close to my heart.
He is a former lecturer at John Bryce College, he helped me a lot and was by my side in my first steps in the programming field, he is the ultimate mentor, and I will always be grateful to him.
